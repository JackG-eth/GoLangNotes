/*
Exercise 1.4: Modify dup2 to print the names of all files in which each
duplicated line occurs.

Solution: I have edited a little bit the original listing, some variable
renamed, blank lines added, code extracted into functions, etc.

Since the counter in dup2 is not per file, but global, the program needs to
keep track of the origin of each line. Reason is, if a line appears first in
file F, and only repeated later in file G, the program still needs to report
F and G for that line.

Had to investigate how to declare and initialize nested maps. The zero value
for a map is printed by %v as an empty map, but smw_ explained in #go-nuts
that they need explicit initialization with make() as seen in countLines().

Also, had to lookup online how to check for key existence.
